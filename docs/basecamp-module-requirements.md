# Basecamp Module Requirements

This is the contract between a module project and `logos-scaffold basecamp {setup,install,launch,reset,build-portable}`. If your project satisfies the rules below, the commands will resolve, build, and install your `.lgx` artefacts into the pre-seeded `alice` and `bob` profiles automatically. `build-portable` additionally targets the `lgx-portable` flake output for hand-loading into a basecamp AppImage.

## Hard requirements

1. **`scaffold.toml` at the project root.** Basecamp commands refuse to run outside a scaffold project. Run `logos-scaffold init` once if you don't have one.

2. **`basecamp setup` must have been run once** in the project. It pins the basecamp repo, builds the `basecamp` + `lgpm` binaries, and seeds the `alice` / `bob` profile directories under `.scaffold/basecamp/profiles/`. `install` and `launch` will emit a targeted hint if you skip this.

3. **At least one `flake.nix`** that exposes a `.lgx` package:
   - Either at the project root, or
   - In one or more immediate sub-directories (one per sub-flake).

4. **Each such flake must expose `packages.<system>.lgx`** — this is the convention established by `logos-module-builder` (tag `tutorial-v1`).
   - If a flake only exposes `packages.<system>.lgx-portable`, the resolver fails explicitly with a hint — it will not silently fall back. Expose `lgx` or pass `--flake <ref>#lgx-portable` on the command line to opt in.
   - If no flake exposes any `.lgx` attribute, the resolver fails with a generic hint pointing at `--path` / `--flake`.

## The captured module set — `[modules]` in scaffold.toml

The set of modules that `basecamp install` / `launch` / `build-portable` will act on lives in `scaffold.toml` as one sub-section per module, keyed by `module_name`:

```toml
[modules.tictactoe]
flake = "path:/abs/tictactoe#lgx"
role = "project"

[modules.delivery_module]
flake = "github:logos-co/logos-delivery-module/1fde1566291fe062b98255003b9166b0261c6081#lgx"
role = "dependency"
```

- **`module_name` is the key** and matches the identifier used in other sources' `metadata.json` `dependencies` array. For `tictactoe_ui`'s manifest to declare `"dependencies": ["tictactoe", "delivery_module"]`, both names must appear as keys here.
- **`role = "project"`** — a module the developer is building locally. `build-portable` attr-swaps these to `#lgx-portable`.
- **`role = "dependency"`** — a runtime companion. `install` / `launch` load them into the profile; `build-portable` skips them (the target AppImage provides its own).

`basecamp modules` is the sole writer of this section. The file stays human-editable — if you disagree with a generated entry, edit it directly.

The pre-0.2.0 schema used `[basecamp.modules.<name>]`. Projects still on that layout are rejected at parse time with a hint pointing at `lgs init`; the section has moved to the top-level `[modules.<name>]` namespace.

### How entries get populated

On every `basecamp modules` run (explicit `--flake` / `--path` args or auto-discovery), scaffold derives `module_name` for each source:

- **`path:` flake refs** → read `<path>/metadata.json.name`. Exact, no guessing.
- **`.lgx` file paths** → read the sibling `metadata.json` if present; otherwise fall back to the filename stem and print a one-line assumption note.
- **`github:` / other remote refs** → derive from the repo slug (strip `logos-` prefix, `-` → `_`) and print a one-line assumption note:
  ```
  note: flake `github:logos-co/logos-storage-module/abc#lgx` — assumed module_name = `storage_module`. If wrong, edit `[modules]` in scaffold.toml.
  ```
  Edit the TOML if the guess is wrong — `basecamp modules` is **idempotent**: existing keys are never overwritten on re-run.

Then for each project source's declared `dependencies`, scaffold resolves a flake ref for any name not already in `[modules]`:

1. **Already keyed in `[modules]`** (any role) → no-op. Whatever you have wins.
2. **Basecamp preinstalls** (`capability_module`, `package_manager`, `package_manager_ui`, `counter`, `counter_qml`, `webview_app`, `basecamp_main_ui`; see `BASECAMP_PREINSTALLED_MODULES` in `src/constants.rs` for the authoritative list) → silent skip, basecamp ships them.
3. **Declaring source's own `flake.lock`** → if the project source declares an input with the same name, scaffold reads the locked `github:<owner>/<repo>/<rev>` and rewrites to `#lgx`. Preferred path for most projects: whatever rev the module is already building against is, by definition, the rev its IPC clients expect at runtime.
4. **Scaffold-default `BASECAMP_DEPENDENCIES`** → a hardcoded table keyed by module name (currently only `delivery_module`). Last-resort safety net for projects that don't carry the dep as a flake input.
5. **Unresolved** → `basecamp modules` **fails with a targeted error** naming the dep and both user-side fixes (capture as a project source, or add an explicit `[modules.<name>]` entry with `role = "dependency"`). No silent drop.

Resolved deps are inserted into `[modules]` with `role = "dependency"`. Re-running `basecamp modules` against the same sources is byte-identical.

Implication for module authors: **declare each runtime dep as a flake input in your module's `flake.nix`**, even if your module doesn't technically build-link against it. It's the cleanest way to give scaffold an authoritative pin (step 3 above) without hitting the scaffold default.

## Local sibling sub-flakes

Multi-flake projects (e.g. a `tictactoe` core plus `tictactoe-ui-cpp` and `tictactoe-ui-qml` sibling flakes) need a way for each sub-flake to resolve its `path:../<sibling>` inputs against the developer's working tree rather than whatever `github:` pin is in its lock.

**Scaffold reads each sub-flake's `flake.nix` to discover its `path:../<sibling>` inputs and emits the matching `--override-input <input_name> path:<abs>` args at both probe and build time.** The input name used in the override is the one declared in `flake.nix` — not the sibling directory name on disk. Directory and input names do not need to match.

Concretely:

- Directory layout `my-module/{tictactoe,tictactoe-ui-cpp,tictactoe-ui-qml}` with `flake.nix` in each.
- `tictactoe-ui-cpp/flake.nix` declares e.g. `inputs.tictactoe_core.url = "path:../tictactoe";` — the input is named `tictactoe_core`, the sibling directory is `tictactoe`.
- Scaffold parses the `flake.nix`, notices the `path:../tictactoe` URL, matches `tictactoe` against the sibling directories on disk, and emits `--override-input tictactoe_core path:/abs/path/to/my-module/tictactoe`.
- At both `basecamp modules` (auto-discovery probe) and `basecamp install` / `build-portable` (the actual build), the same overrides apply; evaluation and build see the same local sibling sources.

Only `path:../<sibling>` inputs are rewritten. `path:./sub`, `github:…`, `git+…` and similar schemes pass through untouched — scaffold has no opinion on them.

### Parser limits

The flake.nix parse is line-level and recognizes `<name>.url = "path:../<sibling>"` and `inputs.<name>.url = "path:../<sibling>"`. Multi-line value forms (e.g. `inputs.x = { url = "…"; flake = false; };` with `url` on its own line inside the nested attrset) are not detected today. If you hit a projects with such a declaration and sibling-override fails, flatten the declaration to the single-line form, or report it and we'll widen the parser.

### Transitive inputs must `follows` the top-level `logos-module-builder`

Multi-sub-flake projects that pull in modules which themselves depend on `logos-module-builder` (e.g. `delivery_module` → `logos-module-builder`) **must** unify that transitive reference onto the project's top-level pin using a `follows` entry.

Without it, your sub-flake's `flake.lock` ends up with two `logos-module-builder` entries: the one you pinned and a second one pulled in transitively (typically off the upstream's `main` branch, which may be incompatible with the `basecamp v0.1.1` wire format or with the tutorial-sanctioned contract). When scaffold then runs `nix build path:<sibling> --override-input <input-name> path:<this-sub-flake>`, nix resolves transitive inputs through **this sub-flake's lock**, and the stale second entry silently wins — builds that work with a direct `nix build .#lgx` fail with opaque errors when invoked through scaffold.

Concrete fix: in each sub-flake that declares both `logos-module-builder` and a module with its own `logos-module-builder` input, add the `follows`:

```nix
# tictactoe/flake.nix (example)
{
  inputs = {
    logos-module-builder.url = "github:logos-co/logos-module-builder/tutorial-v1";
    delivery_module.url = "github:logos-co/logos-delivery-module/<pinned-rev>";

    # Force delivery_module's transitive `logos-module-builder` to follow our
    # tutorial-v1 pin. Without this, delivery_module drags in its own
    # master-branch module-builder (newer, incompatible with basecamp v0.1.1's
    # bundled delivery_module wire format) as a second entry in flake.lock.
    # That extra entry silently wins when a UI flake does
    # `--override-input tictactoe path:...` and breaks the tutorial-sanctioned
    # local-dev workflow.
    delivery_module.inputs.logos-module-builder.follows = "logos-module-builder";
  };
  # ...
}
```

Symptoms when this is missing:

- `lgs basecamp install` fails inside `nix build` with errors from a newer `logos-module-builder` (e.g. `no 'main' field in metadata.json`).
- `cd <sub-flake> && nix build .#lgx` works directly, because the direct build uses the sub-flake's own lock and never dereferences the extra entry.

Apply the same `follows` wiring to every transitive input that *also* pulls in `logos-module-builder`. After adding it, re-run `nix flake update` in that sub-flake and verify `flake.lock` now contains exactly one `logos-module-builder` node (or `logos-module-builder_N` aliases all resolving to the same rev).

This is a limitation of the current tutorial-era `logos-module-builder` scaffolding and is expected to be handled automatically upstream in a later release.

## Explicit escape hatch

If auto-discovery doesn't capture what you want, name the sources explicitly on `basecamp modules`:

```bash
# Pre-built .lgx file
logos-scaffold basecamp modules --path ./dist/my-module.lgx

# Arbitrary flake refs (remote refs, non-standard attrs)
logos-scaffold basecamp modules --flake github:me/my-module#lgx
logos-scaffold basecamp modules --flake .#some-alt-attr
```

Explicit sources skip root / sub-flake probing entirely. The entries land in `[modules]` exactly as specified, `role = "project"`; re-run `basecamp modules` with different args to replace or extend. `basecamp install` then replays whatever the table captures.

To override a single dependency pin without capturing it as a project source, edit `scaffold.toml` directly:

```toml
[modules.delivery_module]
flake = "github:myfork/logos-delivery-module/abc123#lgx"
role = "dependency"
```

`basecamp modules` preserves the entry on every subsequent run — user intent wins over derived pins.

## AppImage testing via `build-portable`

`basecamp install` / `launch` load modules into the scaffold-managed alice/bob profiles. To instead test against a released basecamp **AppImage**, use `build-portable`:

```bash
logos-scaffold basecamp build-portable
# → builds .#lgx-portable for every `role = "project"` entry in [modules]
# → topologically orders by metadata.json dependencies (leaves first,
#   so basecamp can resolve each module's deps before loading it)
# → symlinks the built artefacts into `.scaffold/basecamp/portable/` as
#   `<NN>-<module_name>.lgx` (NN = load-order index) so the AppImage's
#   "install lgx" file picker has browsable, human-named files in the
#   right order — no manual hunting through /nix/store/
# → prints the symlink paths in load order
```

`build-portable` does not touch profiles, `basecamp.state`, or the AppImage itself — it only produces artefacts. Load them into your AppImage in the printed order via its "install lgx" button; scaffold is intentionally unaware of the AppImage's install path.

The `.scaffold/basecamp/portable/` directory is wiped and recreated on every `build-portable` run, so re-running after you've removed a module via `basecamp modules` doesn't leave stale symlinks behind.

If a flake exposes only `lgx` (not `lgx-portable`), `build-portable` fails with a targeted hint — mirror of the `install` portable-only failure, in reverse.

## Quick checklist

- [ ] `scaffold.toml` exists at the project root.
- [ ] `logos-scaffold basecamp setup` has been run.
- [ ] Each sub-flake exposes `packages.<system>.lgx`.
- [ ] Sibling sub-flake URLs use the `path:../<sibling-dir>` form, declared on a single `<name>.url = "…"` line (not split across multiple lines inside a nested attrset — parser limitation).
- [ ] Transitive `logos-module-builder` references are unified with a `follows` onto the top-level pin (see "Transitive inputs must `follows` …" above).
- [ ] No project relies on `lgx-portable` as the only output without passing `--flake` explicitly.
